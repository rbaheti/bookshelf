# MyReads Project

In this project you will see 3 shelves or categories in which a particular book is. The 3 shelves are:
a. Currently reading
b. Want to read
c. Read

There is a dropdown option for each book which helps you in moving a book to a desired shelf.
By clicking on the add button at the bottom of the page, you can search a particular book.
If the book is available in the database, you can add it to one of the shelves. Once done, the book will be added to that shelf. To see that change, go back to the home page.

This entire app is build using ReactJS library. 

Hope you have fun while using this app!
